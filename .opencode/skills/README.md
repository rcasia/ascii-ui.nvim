## What is a Skill?

A skill is a specialized instruction set that provides agents with domain-specific knowledge and workflows. Skills are loaded on-demand when a task matches the skill's scope.

## Available Skills

## Creating a New Skill

1. Create a new directory: `.opencode/skills/<skill-name>/`

## Skill Creation Workflow

1. **Identify pattern**: Repeated task or specialized knowledge needed
2. **Propose skill**: Document what the skill should cover
3. **Create skill**: agent-teacher creates skill directory and files
4. **Test skill**: Agents use skill on relevant tasks
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on agent feedback

## Permissions

- **agent-teacher**: Can create and modify skills
- **Other agents**: Read-only access, load skills as needed

## Integration with Agents

Agents should:
1. Check this directory for relevant skills before starting work
2. Load skills using the `skill` tool when task matches skill scope
3. Report difficulties if skills don't cover the domain
